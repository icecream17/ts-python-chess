/**
 * @contextmanager decorator.

 * Typical usage:
 *
 *    @contextmanager
 *    def some_generator(<arguments>):
 *       <setup>
 *       try:
 *          yield <value>
 *       finally:

 *
 * This makes this:
 *
 *    with some_generator(<arguments>) as <variable>:
 *       <body>
 *
 * equivalent to this:
 *
 *    <setup>
 *    try:
 *       <variable> = <value>
 *       <body>
 *    finally:
 *       <cleanup>
